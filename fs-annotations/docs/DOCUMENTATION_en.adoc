Fs Annotations provides a set of annotations to help your codes stay tidy and clean:

* *Nullable*/*NonNull*: tells the annotated element is nullable/non-null;
* *DefaultNullable*/*DefaultNonNull*: tells all elements which can be annotated by *Nullable*/*NonNull*
in scope of annotated element are nullable/non-null, usually used in package-info.java;
* *AcceptedType*/*AcceptedTypes*: tells which type is accepted;
* *RejectedType*/*RejectedTypes*: tells which type is rejected;
* *OutParam*: tells the parameter is an output param which can be modified;
* *Immutable*: tells the annotated element is immutable;
* *ThreadSafe*: tells the annotated element is thread-safe;
